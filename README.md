## How does it work?
- The application uses Google Authorization, Node.js, Mongo and MySql databases, Handlebars.js, Express.js and EJS (Embedded Javascript Templating). 
1. A user first will sign in with their Google Id.
2. The user will choose to join an already existing group or create a new group.
3. If the user joins an existing group, they will be prompted for the group password (generated at the time the group was created).
- The user will be taken to the Idea page for that group where they can review submitted ideas.
- The user will also be able to click a button to see what the winning vote was for this group.
4. If the user chooses to create a group they will fill out a form for the new group consisting of an admin name, email, group name, the decision to be made, number of group members and a group password.
- The user will be taken to the Idea page where the topic will be displayed.
- Here the uesr will enter a minimum of 5 votes. 
- Once all users have entered their minimum votes a modal or buttons will appear allowing the users to see the winning vote.
